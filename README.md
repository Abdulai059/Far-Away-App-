Far Away App
A simple React project I built while learning key React concepts.

ðŸ›  What I Learned
State Management â€“ using useState to store and update data.

Lifting State Up â€“ sharing data between components by moving state to a common ancestor.

Derived State â€“ calculating values from existing state for cleaner code.

Child-to-Parent Communication â€“ passing data and events from child components back to the parent using props.

ðŸš€ Purpose
This project is part of my React learning journey, helping me understand how components interact and manage data flow.
